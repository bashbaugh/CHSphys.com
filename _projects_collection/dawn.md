Dawn Aerospace, a start-up company based in New Zealand, [tasked teams with designing a paint scheme and payload for their new Mk-II suborbital space plane.](https://www.dawnaerospace.com/paint-our-plane) Our team won the payload slot for the contest, giving us the opportunity to send an experiment to the upper atmosphere. We are hoping to sample the air in the mesosphere at 60 km altitude to learn about the effects of climate change and air pollution in the upper atmosphere. We are excited about this partnership with Dawn Aerospace because their Mk-II space plane will allow us to access a part of the atmosphere that has not been thoroughly researched in the past.

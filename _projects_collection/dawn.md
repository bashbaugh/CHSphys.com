summary: Recently, we were awarded the payload slot on Dawn Aerospace's space plane, and we are working on creating a payload to collect air samples and measure pollutants in the mesosphere!

Dawn Aerospace, a start-up company based in New Zealand, [tasked teams with designing a paint scheme and payload for their new Mk-II suborbital space plane.](https://www.dawnaerospace.com/paint-our-plane) Our team won the payload slot for the contest, giving us the opportunity to send an experiment to the upper atmosphere. We are hoping to sample the air in the [mesosphere](https://scied.ucar.edu/shortcontent/mesosphere-overview) at around 60 km altitude to learn about the effects of climate change and air pollution in the upper atmosphere. We are excited about this partnership with Dawn Aerospace because their Mk-II space plane will allow us to access a part of the atmosphere that [has not been thoroughly researched in the past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere#Exploration).

Our goal is to collect air samples using a pump system for analysis back on Earth, and also possibly collect in-flight data from various sensors. We plan to analyze and measure the presence of several gasses including SF6 and N2O.

However, designing a suitable air intake and sensing system for the low-pressure air in the mesosphere has been no easy task and we'll need funding to purchase and construct the parts (such as a vacuum pump)! Therefore, [please donate, if you can](/donate)!

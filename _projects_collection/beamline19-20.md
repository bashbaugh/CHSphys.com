The Beamline for Schools competition challenges teams from across the world to design experiments for a particle accelerator and propose their ideas via a 1000-word written proposal and one-minute video. In 2019, we proposed an experiment comparing the Cherenkov Radiation of matter (electrons) and antimatter (positrons) through several mediums. We placed as international finalists among the top 20 of 200 teams from around the world.

In December 2019, Physics Club participated in the JPL Invention Challenge in Pasadena, California. We were tasked with building a device that could launch ten ping pong balls a distance of five meters to land in a mason jar within one minute. While we only successfully landed one of the balls in the jar due to mis-calibrating our device, we had fun making the machine, and we won the “Most Artistic” award for our creative design.

Here's a picture of us with our certificate after the challenge:

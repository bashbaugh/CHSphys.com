Hey, we need your help! We're currently working on our [mesospheric atmosphere research project](/projects#dawn-aerospace-mesosphere), but we need funding for a vacuum pump and other components that will be placed aboard the [space plane](https://www.dawnaerospace.com/deliver) for air intake, sampling and analysis of the [mesosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere). 

Any contributions are welcome. **[Please click here to donate on RevTrak](https://centaurushigh.revtrak.net/Optional-Fees-School-Events-Admission/physics-club/#/v/physics-club-donation)**. Or, if you want to make a non-monetary contribution, such as scientific or manufacturing resources, please [contact us](/contact)

We are a group of students from Centaurus High School in Lafayette, Colorado who love STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math). We have participated in many contests, including CERN’s Beamline for Schools competition, Dawn Aerospace’s Paint Our Plane contest, and NASA’s JPL Invention Challenge. We have also visited the Colorado State Capitol to encourage state legislators to recognize the importance of public schools.
